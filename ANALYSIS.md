ANALYSIS PART #2

Just like in every area of our lives, artificial intelligence tools have become more popular in the field of programming day by day. Vibe coding tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, Replit Agent, v0.dev and Bolt.new have become an important part of coding today. These tools are also quite different from normal code completion, GitHub Copilot and using ChatGPT separately.

Normal code completion helps us complete the code we write in the IDE. It gives small suggestions while we are typing. However, it doesn’t fully understand what we want to do because it focuses only on the word we write. For example, when we type a function name, it suggests the rest of the code automatically. Vibe coding tools are very different from this. You clearly write what you want to do, and the tool creates the code and files for you. For example, when you write that you want to build a to-do list website in Cursor, it can create basic files like index.html, style.css and script.js. It thinks about the whole project, not only single words.

GitHub Copilot is another tool that helps with coding. It suggests the next part of the code and tries to guess what you will write. In Copilot, the control is mostly in the user’s hands because it works while the user is writing. On the other hand, in vibe coding tools, you can leave more control to the tool. It can write code for you, create files and fix errors. These tools are more active than Copilot. When you give a task to Bolt.new or Replit Agent, they can write detailed code even if the user doesn’t write much. They can also give different examples of how the code can continue.

Using ChatGPT in a separate tab is also very common. ChatGPT gives code examples and helps when we do not understand something. However, changing tabs all the time can cause a small waste of time. Copying and pasting code can also become boring after a while. One big advantage of vibe coding tools is that they work inside the IDE. For example, in Cursor, you can ask questions and fix errors while writing code. This helps save a lot of time.

In my opinion, using vibe coding tools makes the learning process more effective, faster and more enjoyable. They help you overcome the fear of “I can’t do this” and replace it with motivation. For example, I used Cursor in my web design project. At the beginning, I was worried about what to do and how to do it. But I tried again and again, so I started to understand and enjoy the process. When I gave correct prompts, I got very good results.
However, if we only trust these tools and don’t check the code and try to understand it, it becomes hard to improve in programming. If we just give prompts and continue without understanding the code, we don’t learn anything. This can cause us to stay at the beginning.

In conclusion, if we use vibe coding tools with focusing on learning, we can both learn and enjoy the process. Like everything else, the key is to use these tools correctly.
