I chose Cursor because it felt more reliable to me. One important reason is that Cursor is an installed desktop application, not a web-based tool. Working only on a web-based platform feels more tiring, and I also worry that if the browser suddenly closes, my project might be lost. Using an installed application made me feel safer while working on my assignment.
After installing Cursor, I used the following prompt:
“Create a modern Todo List app with HTML, CSS, and JS where each task has a title and a due date, all tasks are saved in LocalStorage, so they don’t disappear on refresh, and completed tasks automatically move to a ‘Completed’ section. Include add, edit, delete, and complete features.”
Using this prompt, Cursor created the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and generated a well-functioning Todo List application. The app included all the basic features I asked for, and it worked well without major problems. However, at first, Cursor didn’t create a README file. When I asked for it, it generated a very long README. After I asked it to revise and simplify the file, it created a much better and cleaner version that was suitable for the project. The only part I changed manually was the name of the web page.
I didn’t struggle much during the development process. The AI was very helpful and responsive. I was surprised by how quickly it completed the tasks. It prepared all the files in a very short time.
After this experience, I realized that Cursor will probably become one of the tools I keep installed on my computer. I would use it whenever I need help, because even small assistance can make a big difference. However, I also sometimes wonder if there will still be a place for humans in the coding world as AI keeps improving. At the same time, watching technology develop is an interesting experience.
